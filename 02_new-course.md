A new course that I introduced is the IB Digital Society which is a humanities based course in CS that 
focuses on a larger impact of digital technology on civilization. Unlike the APCS and the IB Computer Science
courses, IB Digital Society places less emphasis on coding but does not avoid it at all. Rather, it begs the question
of how this idea of digitization and computional/algorithmic thinking evolved with the aid of technology.
The course is intended for social science and history students who may not have the opportunity or desire to 
engage in intensive computing / coding.
This course is offered to 12th graders who need an elective but it can also fulfill the requirements for a math or science
course in a very liberal way.

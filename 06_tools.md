 ## Google Classroom
### General Purpose:
Allows teachers and student to post class materials and as a hub for all class related activity.

### Class Used:
All Classes - IB Economics, IB Mathematics, IB TOK, IB CAS, Algebra I

### How I Use It:
I use Classroom to post all materials that are used in class especially links to resources and OER / OpenStax textbooks.
Students use it to submit assignments and projects.

### Why This Tool
I use it primarily because the school has adopted it as a de facto LMS. 

## R Studio
### Statistical Programming Tool
### Class Used: 
IB Mathematics and IB Economics

### How I use it:
In Math, I use R for all statistical analysis cases and students learn to work with large datasets.
In Econ, I use it primarily for linear regression problems and non-parametric analysis related to economic data.

### Why this tool:
It is free and most textbooks in Statistics already support the R and provide pre-written activities that allows students to get started with R programming and use it in their classwork.

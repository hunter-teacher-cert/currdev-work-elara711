# Asynchronous Work
#### Most asynchronous work will happen over slack.
Asynchronous work is meant to take up the balance of our class time, since our live zoom sessions are only 1:15 long. Most often, asynchronous activities will take place as discussions over slack in the \#async_curdev slack channel. Usually, you will be asked to post and then respond to posts from others. As such, it is important to the whole class that you do not wait until the start of the following class to do your asynchronous work. If possible, take the remaining time at the end of our zoom sessions to at least add your post.

# Session 07: 11/03
## Assignment
* Finish the unit plan template
  - This should be the README.md file in your main unit plan repository.
  - Based on the previous assignment these things should be added:
    - Tools used
    - External resources
    - Lessons
      - This should be the sequence of lessons and their topics.
    - Assessments
      - This should be a list/brief description of any assessments.


# Session 06: 10/27
## Assignment
*  filename: **06_tools.md**
* Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
  - The name of the tool.
  - What its general purpose is.
  - The class(es) you use it in.
  - How you use it in class.
  - Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?

## Async
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
  - Pick two different tech tools that fall under the same general category (like IDE, communication ). Provide a brief description of each, then compare and contrast them. Do you have a recommendation?


# Session 05: 10/13
## Assignment
* filename: **05_assignments.md**
  * Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan.
  * Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file. Save this file in your own personal work repository.
  * This is individual work, that can be incorperated into your unit plan later.

## Asynchronous
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
  * Make a post describing an assignment that you are proud of.
    - Make this post by Monday so that others can respond.
    - If you have never created an assignment, reply to 2 more (5 total) posts instead.
  * Reply *as a thread* to at least 3 other posts with your thoughts on their assignment.
    - The replies must be done by the next class session.

# Session 04: 10/06
## Assignment
* title: **04_langauge.md**
  * Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
  * Answer the following prompts:
    - What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
    - What is the language?
    - How does one write & run code in this language?
    - Rate the complexity of the syntax?
    - Strengths
    - How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
    - Weaknesses
    - How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
    - Why did you select this language for this class?

## Asynchronous:
Pick 2 (or more) of the languages looked at in class other than the one you discussed in your breakout room. Perform a similar analysis on them as you did in class. Use that imformation to help inform your choice for the assignment.
1. Processing: <https://processing.org/>
   * Sample: <https://processing.org/examples/setupdraw.html>
2. Scratch/Snap: <https://scratch.mit.edu/>
3. Netlogo <https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>
   * Sample: <http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Evolution/Genetic%20Drift/GenDrift%20P%20global.nlogo>
4. Javscript <https://www.javascript.com/>
   * Resources: <https://www.javascript.com/resources>
5. Racket/Scheme <https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/>

# Session 03: 09/22 or 09/29
## Assignment
Fill out the following sections in your unit plan template:
* General Overview
* Motivation for Unit
* Standards Referenced

## Asynchronous:
Use your asybnchrous time to get some movement on your fieldwork. Either recrod & upload a class, or observe/watch someone else. Don't forget to log it on your spreadsheet.

# Session 02: 09/15
## Assignment
* title: **02_new-course.md**
* Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
* Make sure to include the following:
  * General description of the course
  * Target audiance
  * Where it fits along with the other courses in your school

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
* Share a topic that you are considering to use for the unit plan project.
* Explain what class it would fit into, and why you chose this particular topic.
* What computer science curricular needs does this topic fill?
* Reply to two other posts.
  * You must choose posts that are about unit plans from a different grade-level/course-level than your unit.
  * In each reply explain the connections between the two units, and how your unit can support or be supported by the other.

# Session 01: 09/08
## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
  * Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
* Have one person from each breakout room post about the selected CSP curriculum with the following information:
  - What tool(s) are used
  - Is there a specific instructional focus, if so, what?
  - Is there a specific content focus, if so, what?
* Each person from that room should reply to that post with the following:
  - How well does it match up with the [College Board's CSP Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-at-a-glance.pdf)?
  - What is the best part of this curriculum?
  - What is something you believe could be improved about this curriculum? How would you improve it?

# Session 00: 09/01
## Assignment:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
  * Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
  * You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel, continued from class:
* As a group, create a slack post that summarizes your group's discussion on the points you were discussing:
  * Do you think this concept is a major part of computer science?
  * How well do the individual standards support the concept?
  * How well do the standards seem to conform to given grade levels?
  * Are there areas of this concept that are missing?
* Individually: Look over the different concept/sub-concept threads. Pick 3 (of the ones you didnâ€™t discuss in class), read the related material for those three, and provide your response to the prompts.

How well do the individual standards support the concept? How well do the standards seem to conform to given grade levels? Are there areas of this concept that are missing? Individually: Look over the different concept/sub-concept threads. Pick 3 (of the ones you didnâ€™t discuss in class), read the related material for those three, and provide your response to the prompts.

## Assignment


**Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms (Processing, Scratch/Snap, Netlogo) that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)**

I have already taught AP CSP so I will definitely stay with Scratch and Snap.

The other course I teach is IB Digital Societies and students are permitted to use any coding language. The Grades are 11 and 12.

Scratch/Snap is a block-based coding but I always ask students to outline a brief pseudocode.

The syntax is not very nuanced and the visual nature of the blocks allows real-time error checking -- if it doesn't fit, don't use it!

I assign very easy and "obvious" tasks in the beginning to give the students an opportunity to ease-in into the environment. Subsequent tasks build on the prior learning.

I try to wean students away from block based coding by showing pseudo-code and snippets of equivalent codes in python and jave for the control structures and the output commands. This serves the purpose of teaching the connctions between block-based and text based coding.

I chose this language because my school adopted the BJC and had agreements to use it in exchange for the professional workshops and resources.

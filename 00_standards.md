Impacts of Computing --> Society --> 9-12.IC.1
Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

Access to technology is a very strong precursor of economic inequality and disparities. One only needs to look at the development of methods of warfare
to see that technology is always used militarily. Computers are not any different. I teach Economics and a basic idea is that the major resources -- Land, Labor, and Capital -- is augmented by Technology to expand the output of society. Computing technologies have allowed Western societies to mechanize and computerize the production 
of agricultural products and thus enhance both land, labor, and smart-capital in the form of harvester and farm equipment.


Cybersecurity --> Safeguards --> 9-12.CY.4
Evaluate applications of cryptographic methods.

Initially, we study the Caesar Cipher to understand the concept of decryption, encryption, methodology, and a key. Then we study other types of cyphers (Bacon, Book, Railroad, etc.) and how they are applied differently. I created a Breakout Box (similar to Escape the Room) involving 6 different types of cyphers with clues hidden around the room. The students have to figure out which cipher to apply and find the correct keys in order to unlock the boxes.

 ### Compare BJC and code.org
 ***
 **Similarities**
1. Both curriculums meet the standards and requirements of CSP and highlight the major ideas in CS to expand the conceptual ideas of students about CS in a larger scale.
2. Both curriculums uses block-based language to deliver the content of CSP which is easier for students who don't have strong programming background to start with.             
 **Differences**
 1.  BJC's lessons are more project based and allows for student independent solutions. This curriculum is designed to attract "non-CS" types who may be erroneously self identifying as non-AP level or non-techy types. 
 2. code.org's lessons provides more scaffolding and support for students to understand. The teaching resources make it easier to implement.

_Compare strengths and weaknesses_
    BJC resources and exercises can be boring after the first 2-3 weeks and most students' drop off. Code.org offers a wider-range and variety of activities and recources. BJC is best suited for younger students and older students with a deeper engagement in CS will enjoy Code.org  and CS better.
    
I have used BJC and modified it by pulling resources from other sites - https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/games/. I also used textbooks on gaming with Scratch that offers pre-build code that students can easily tinker with.

In the module about simulation, I introduce students to the topic by using a simpe TI-84 probability simulation that captures the essence of a dice throw and then I use the BJC. This allows the transfer of prior knowledge to another.
